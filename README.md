Create a mini-webserver that uses custom annotations to route browser requests to specific handler methods.

## Description
The task is to create a mini-webserver that uses annotations to route browser requests to specific handler methods.
It is a perfect chance to get familiar with simple annotations.

Use Java 8's built-in webserver.
Create a custom annotation which can be used to annotate methods. These will be your HTTP request handlers whenever a request accepted by the webserver matches 
the "path" value in the annotation.

Support GET, POST, etc. optionally as well.
